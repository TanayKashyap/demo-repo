    "The last line is using the formula in the text on Page 67.  How can you derive that formula?  Hint: you can get the PV of a finite set of cashflows by considering two perperuities (at different points in time).  Remember that perpetuties are easy to value and have a really nice formula. Come prepared to derive the bond pricing formula and you'll win the day, and get top participation points for this week."
