    "After you have completed the assignment as instructed, you will hand in your two files.  The bonus part is separate from this, and saved under a new file titled \"Market_Index_Bonus_NAME.ipynb\" where NAME is your complete name.  You need only hand in your bonus code, thus if you are doing the bonus, you will hand in three files, two for the main assignment, and one for the bonus.  Please note that this bonus quesiton is not easy, and the bonus point will only be awarded if you are sucessful.  DO NOT hand in unsuccessful attempts.  Although this part is not worth much relative to the amount of work it will take, this level of coding will be required in the group assignment, and potentially in individual assignment 4.  Thus, it may be worth attempting so that you aren't overwhelmed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete the bonus part, you must write fully dynamic code that allows the user (your professor and the marker) to specify any (finite) number of (valid) US stock tickers to include in the index.  Your code must start by defining a list: Tickers = [\"ticker1\", \"ticker2\", \"ticker3\",...,\"tickerN\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "We will test your code with a predefined list of tickers, the length of which is unknown to you (hint: it will be greater than 3, but not so large that it will take too long to call up all the market data and manipulate it).

    "\n",
    "For each index, determine the portfolio value based on the weights. This information should be stored in a DataFrame with a column for the date, each stock price, their respective weights and the final portfolio value at each point in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each method, use data from `Jan 1, 2018` to `Jan 1, 2021` to build the indices. The prices you use should be the **CLOSING** prices.\n",

    "### a) Price Weighted Index\n",
    "We will use the simplest method, as discussed in the class slides.  \"In the simplest form, an average/price weighted index is calculated by adding each stock price and dividing by the # of stocks\".  This is what the price weighted index will track over time.\n",

    "### b) Market Capitalisation Weighted Index\n",
    "Each stock is weighted according to its market capitalization relative to the other stocks.  The beginning value of the index is arbitrary, it simply represents a size of your portfolio.  The key is that your portfolio is created according to the weights of each individual stock.  To allow us to compare the two index methods, you are to set the the **first market weighted index value equal to the first price weighted index value**.  If for example, the first price weighted index value is 1000, then you can imagine that this is the amount of money that you have to build your market capitalization index portfolio.   You will need to calculate the number of shares you purchase using the weights and prices of that first day. The next day you will update according to new prices and weightings to determine the next portfolio.   It may be helpful to imagine that at each day, you sell your portfolio at the prevailing prices, and then purchase a new portfolio according to the new weights with the money from the sold portfolio.  Although this may sound like a lot of details, it is precisely how the S&P 500 index is derived each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Display the first five values of the date and the respective portfolio values from the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT:** It will be useful to have your DataFrame contain the prices of the stocks and the number of shares purchased of each stock for each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**HINT:** To obtain your index value at each point in time, you will require information from one period before.  This is best accomplished with the use of a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ASSUMPTION:** To calculate the market capitalisation, you can make the assumption that the number of shares outstanding does not change and multiply that by the share price for each day."
